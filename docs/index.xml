      <description>Navigating Kubernetes Custom Metrics and HPA Custom Metric API Provider This post assumes a few things:
 You have a kubernetes cluster setup and kubectl correctly configured You have a custom metrics api deployed into the cluster  For clarity, the custom metrics api that I am using is the prometheus-adapter. Some may be implemented differently so your mileage may vary.
Using the Custom Metrics API kubectl get --raw &amp;#34;/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1&amp;#34; | jq This outputs a list of available metrics in the custom metrics api.</description>

      <description>Handwired Planck A foray into handwired keyboards
Why the Planck This isn&amp;rsquo;t my first custom keyboard. Nor will it probably be my last. But this is the first time I did the wiring myself including setting up the microcontroller.
I started into keyboards by buying a Magiforce 86. I got it as a Drop (back then it was called MassDrop) and started out with Cherry MX Brown switches. It was a good board, but I found the browns to be a bit mushy.</description>
