      <description>Handwired Planck A foray into handwired keyboards
Why the Planck This isn&amp;rsquo;t my first custom keyboard. Nor will it probably be my last. But this is the first time I did the wiring myself including setting up the microcontroller.
I started into keyboards by buying a Magiforce 86. I got it as a Drop (back then it was called MassDrop) and started out with Cherry MX Brown switches. It was a good board, but I found the browns to be a bit mushy.</description>
