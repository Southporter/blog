      <description>Dactyl Manuform I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to build a Dactyl Manuform for a while. Since diving into mechanical keyboards, I&amp;rsquo;ve been particularly interested in the ergonomics of typing. The Dactyl is an interesting keyboard for a couple of reasons.
 It&amp;rsquo;s is parameterized. This means you can change a few inputs and get a customized keyboard. The concave nature and thumb cluster improve ergonomics.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving the my handwired planck for about 2 years now and have really liked the keyboard.</description>

      <description>Handwired Planck A foray into handwired keyboards
Why the Planck This isn&amp;rsquo;t my first custom keyboard. Nor will it probably be my last. But this is the first time I did the wiring myself including setting up the microcontroller.
I started into keyboards by buying a Magiforce 86. I got it as a Drop (back then it was called MassDrop) and started out with Cherry MX Brown switches. It was a good board, but I found the browns to be a bit mushy.</description>
