<p>A foray into handwired keyboards</p>
<h3 id="why-the-planck">Why the Planck<a href="#why-the-planck" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t my first custom keyboard. Nor will it probably be my last. But this is the first time I did the wiring myself including setting up the microcontroller.</p>
<p>I started into keyboards by buying a Magiforce 86. I got it as a Drop (back then it was called MassDrop) and started out with Cherry MX Brown switches. It was a good board, but I found the browns to be a bit mushy. That, and I had started to get some strain on my wrists from the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>I then dove into <a href="https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">/r/mechanicalkeyboards</a> and researched the various types and styles of keyboards. Split keyboards, ortholinear keyboards were the most interesting to me. I decided to try out the <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/levinson-lets-split-w-led-backlight">Levinson</a>.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my split Planck. It&rsquo;s been a great keyboard for everyday use. Keeping everything within 1 movement from home row as much as possible has great benefits.</p>
<h3 id="into-handwiring">Into handwiring<a href="#into-handwiring" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>I have always had a desire to better understand electronics and computers. They fascinate me. So naturally I wanted to get a little deeper into how <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK</a> and keyboards work.</p>
<h3 id="parts-assemble">Parts Assemble!<a href="#parts-assemble" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>I collected the initial parts. I got <a href="https://drop.com/buy/novelkeys-x-kaihua-kalih-speed-heavy-switches">Kaihl Speed Heavy Switches</a>, the Burnt Orange variety. I prefer heavier switches and wanted to try out the Speed switches because of their quicker actuation.</p>
<p>I wanted a fairly minimal design, so I got <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/cases-plates/products/levinson-keyboard-case-plates">PCB plates</a> from keeb.io. I was a little worried that they might bow when typing on them, but that hasn&rsquo;t been the case for me.</p>
<p>I wanted to try out XDA style keycaps and really liked the <a href="https://mitormk.com/portfolio/xda-canvas-round-2-2018/">Mito Canvas</a>. I got those in another Drop.</p>
<p>Once I got all those parts, I couldn&rsquo;t help but plug the switches into the plates, pop on the keycaps and enjoy the view. It&rsquo;s only so satisifying to have all the physical parts put together though, so now I needed all the electronics.</p>
<p>I got some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BWC596B">wire</a> and some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079KJ91JZ">diodes</a> back in 2018. As soon as I got them, I soldered all the diodes to the switches. To solder the diodes, I bent all the diodes on one side against a book. After making a loop on one side with a pair of needlenose plier, I set that on the left pin of the switch and applied solder to get it to stay.</p>
<p>Then, as it always does, life happened and I got busy. This project fell by the wayside until March of 2020.</p>

<p>With a sudden event that forced most people to work from home, I now had a bit more time on my hands. I also forgot to bring my keyboard home. Typing on the Macbook keyboard reminded me why I got into keyboards in the first place, and I decided to finally finish this project.</p>
<p>I started by soldering the left side of the board. I started with the rows:
