# Handwired Planck

A foray into handwired keyboards


### Why the Planck
This isn't my first custom keyboard. Nor will it probably be my last. But this is the first time I did the wiring myself including setting up the microcontroller.

I started into keyboards by buying a Magiforce 86. I got it as a Drop (back then it was called MassDrop) and started out with Cherry MX Brown switches. It was a good board, but I found the browns to be a bit mushy. That, and I had started to get some strain on my wrists from the mouse and keyboard.

I then dove into [/r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) and researched the various types and styles of keyboards. Split keyboards, ortholinear keyboards were the most interesting to me. I decided to try out the [Levinson](https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/levinson-lets-split-w-led-backlight).
